  Understanding AWS Direct Connect for VMware Cloud on AWS

An AWS Direct Connect (DX) service can be ordered directly from AWS (Dedicated Connection) although, there may be situations where there is a need to order and provision a DX service via an AWS Direct Connect Partner based on the following criteria:

•	AWS DX speed is sub-1Gbps
•	Availability of the DX service in the particular location is only supported by an AWS Partner

Leveraging an AWS Partner provided multiple options on which types of DX connectivity types are available:

•	Hosted Virtual InterFace (VIF)
•	Hosted Connection

The definition of these AWS Direct Connect service types from AWS Partners, their Direct Connect service types and locations can be located here:
