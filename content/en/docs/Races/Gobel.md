## Basic Information

### Anatomy & Morphology

The Gobels of Solinia are a varied race, with skin colour ranging from earthy brown, greys to dull greens. Some are as stout as the Morannon and short as the Eusebians, whilst others can be tall and burly and taller than Vishim. With large, pointed ears and sometimes tusks and crooked horns. They can have long or squat noses and are often very ugly, to a human, at least. Some have long, curling tails with a tuft of hair on the end, or else end with a diamond shaped point. There's very little difference between males and females, with females perhaps being a little more slight.  Their clothes are primitive cloth and leather, but they love to cover their bodies in warpaint and the occasional crudely formed piece of armour; effective in it's defense, but not made for comfort.

### Common Etiquette Rules

Gobel are often seen as stupid, though this is not entirely true. They may not be great philosophers, but they outmatch most in their tactical cunning which they developed through centuries of war with the Morannon in the Under. Their intelligence shines through in many forms from their use of complex tools to their invention of a writing system that, albeit crude, is relatively effective in its use. Despite their relative intelligence Gobel still most often resort to violence to anything else in situations they do not understand. Most Gobel prefer the use of weapons, but they still more than retain the ability to use their hands as an effective method of eliminating prey.  While some scholars do believe Gobel still maintain the ability to ascend to a higher status of intelligence their brutish and cunning nature has very well prevented them from attaining anything in the way of intellectual status amongst the races.

### Culture and Cultural Heritage

Gobel society is largely tribal, although the tribes meet once in a while to choose a racial leader, the Gurduk’shai. This “election” of sorts is a series of challenges, and fights against the monsters of the Under, where all the candidates participate at the same time. Should one defeat all the monsters, which is a rare occurrence indeed, the last competitors are pitted against eachother in a fight to the death. The last one to stay alive wins the title, having survived the Gurduk’sha. Gobel children are taught from their earliest years how to fight, making them exceptional warriors.

### History

OriginsEdit  Legends have it that Lord Erebus, a noble of the early Proto Humans, fled for the Under at the cusp of the cataclysm and was charged with his life for his people to pass through the gates of Id-Kura. Agreeing, they safely passed under the great gate and into the Under where they remained for millennia. When the cataclysm had finally ended, the proto humans made their way to the surface to find themselves charged once more by The Titan to pass through. As is dictated by the code of the great gate, they were presented with their challenge. There lay in front of them their beloved ruler now a twisted image of himself and with dominion over endless armies of similarly savage and dangerous beasts he named Gobel.  The battle was fierce and lasted weeks, the Gobel never tiring and the proto-humans suffering endless losses. It was not until a skilled archer by the name of Sheia Kandam entered the battle did the tides did turn. For Sheia’s arrows were poisoned tipped with Under Mold and Gobel became weakened and struggled to fight the effects. Erebus was never truly defeated that day, but weakened enough for their people to escape the Under and flee Kandam to make their new home. The Eusebian people of Alcor still honour this great battle to this day and hold festivals to mark the day they fled the Under.  It is said that Erebus still tramples the Under, crushing the many races that come before him and his Gobel armies endlessly seeking those who escaped him.
