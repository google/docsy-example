Gialon
{{% /pageinfo %}}

Very little is known of the ancient elemental race known as gialons. Their origins are mostly a mystery except some writings in their history on on Nasudana. Elementals venerate the Elemental Pantheon from which they owe their origins. Most elementals can be found far under the earth, high a top mountains, volcanos and the deepest of oceans. Their culture is generally lawless and without structure, they have very little hierarchy and can more often than not be found more commonly bound to a magician or serving the will of the gods on the Elemental Planes

# Location

Oldest known records of them of Gialon are on Nasudana

# Culture

The Gialon race are individualistic and spontanious, motivated usually by selfish reasons. They are mischevious towards other races, intelligent and can be spiteful in their tricks.

Despite this nastier streak, they are never fully malicious. They are carefree, taking their surroundings and lives for granted. More recently they have had to realise some responsibility for their natural homes, joining the Sylvan Sentinels.

Elemental culture is mostly lawless, primarily matriarchal with women holding positions of power. Occasionally, males can be found in leading roles, but this is rather rare. In fact, leading roles in general are rare as elementals are most peaceful amongst themselves and rarely bothered enough to take organised action on a large scale.

Elemental forces of fire, earth, wind and water holds a great place in their culture. As primarily elemental beings they have great command over their abilities.

Elementals naturally live forever, but they can lose their immortality if they fall in love with a member of a mortal race. As tricksters, this can happen much more than you would think. Many take great glee in having mortals fall for them, finding it amusing, however, they often find themselves with feelings in return...

Elemental settlements reflect their Element and are in-keeping with their natural surrounds. Air elementals inhabit woodlands, often living within natural holes in tree trunks. Earth elementals inhabit rocky caves and earthy glens, Water elementals rarely leave the shore of their lakes. Fire elementals travel the wilderness, hiding from rain showers and starting wildfires, or aiding travellers who are in need of light and warmth.
