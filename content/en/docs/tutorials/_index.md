Tutorials are **complete worked examples** made up of **multiple tasks** that
guide the user through a relatively simple but realistic scenario: building an
application that uses some of your project’s features, for example. If you have
already created some Examples for your project you can base Tutorials on them.
This section is **optional**. However, remember that although you may not need
this section at first, having tutorials can be useful to help your users engage
with your example code, especially if there are aspects that need more
explanation than you can easily provide in code comments.
