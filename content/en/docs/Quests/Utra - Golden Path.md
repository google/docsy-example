You give Old Farza the Archaic Markings

The merchant trader snorts some unusual looking green spice and smiles a toothy grin in your direction 'So you come to ol' Farza do you? Looking for lost Utran pottery? No! The finest of Lunathian wine! Ohhhh... no, you have something.. yes ... very very old, pass it over to old Farza.' The trader takes the small runic stone and gazes over it, feeling along its surface and fingering the lettering with his weather hands. 'Yes, Darnan, second century... unusual... not words that Farza has seen before. A specialist you will need, for a bag of gold, maybe I can advice you... yes!' he smiles his toothy smile and places out his hand

You receive Ancient Tablet

You give Old Farza a Bag of Gold

Old Farza says 'Good! You make an old merchant happy, and glad to help you, naturally! Old Farza never lets you down! Hahaa, So to understand this text, you need a linguist, and yes, there are great linguists in the library in Tanqara, but you need a specialist! An expert in Darnan languages! And where do you people fascinated with the Darnar.....? In Darnar ruins of course! Old Farza travels many times between Tanqara and Lunathis and there are many ruins in a forest to the west of Tanqara. Travel up the northern path from Tanqara and head West. You will find Guzel the Archeologist, maybe his corpse, perhaps. But if this the case, its not old Farza fault. Either way, tell him Farza send you.

Hail Guzel

Gaagggh more disturbance! More delays! WHAT DO YOU WANT

You give Guzel the Ancient Tablet

Gaagggh snatches the tablet from your hands 'What is this? Wait... hmm... second century... a trade document?' He peers closely at the lettering 'No... impossible! New script? NEW SCRIPT! This surely is a forgery? Who did you get this from'

You say Orcs

Guzel snorts 'Oh please! What use would Orcs have with an ancient tablet, they can barely read Tanqaran let alone second century darnan! Though... hmmm. yess it does seem strange an orc would be making a forgery.... Perhaps it is worth further study, but some of these words... old... lost, BUT! We are in the best place! This whole forest is full of ancient darnan ruins! If we could find more pieces with these unknown words perhaps we could put together what they means? So what do you think? Want to do some work for Guzel?'

You say I will work for you

Guzel beams a smile 'Excellent yes! You look far more rugged than an old man like Guzel, go in there, where those skeletons are... see what old items they hold onto that Guzel can decipher. Might take a few pieces'

You give Guzel Common Rune Tablet

Guzel looks over the Tablet and nods, 'yes yes, very familiar to me, but sadly not much use to us for this case, keep looking!'

You give Guzel Faded Rare Tablet

Guzel carefully snatches the tablet from your hands 'Careful! The writings in this tablet could be one of a kind! Do you wish for us to lose this knowledge forever?! So hmmm... Just another trade tablet! I'm afraid you are going to have to dig deeper and try to find something more interesting'

You give Guzel Disk of the Sunless

Guzel beams as you uncover the perfectly preserved circular tablet 'My my, what do we have here? What an unusual shape and such a high quality! It looks to have been preserved perfectly and is filled with...' He rubs his finger along the symbols in a clockwise motion... 'a prayer... Yes a prayer to a God! I must get this back to my library and cross reference against the archive. It may take me some time so please see my assistant Szsen in Lunathis, he will let you know when the translation is complete and how it may relate to what you seek. I can't guarantee a 100% translation but I will do my best. You have done an old man well, please take this as a reward. Till we meet again!'

You receive Ancient Darnar Belt
You receive the title Archeologist

You say Hail Szsen

Szsen says 'Very busssssy is Sssszsssseennnn, no timesssss for youssss. That inbecccccile Guzel hassss me working on usssselesssss ressssssearch'

You say Guzel sent me

Szsen says 'The sssstudy of the tabletsssss isss in progressss but the complete transssslation will take sssome time. Szsen wondersss why the ccccircular tablet is sssso fassccinating for you? Sssssurely Szsen hassss much more interessssting things for you'

You say what things?

Szsen says 'Guzel had aquired a fassssincating partial sssspear that ssssseemed to predate even firssssst century Darnan. It wassss in our possesssion but one of the blue-ones tried to sssssteal it from usssss. In the sssstruggle the spear was broken into two piecesssss. I musssssst reaquire thissss artifact. Will you help Szsen return thissss to the collection?'

You say I will help

Szsen says 'Good, this pleasssses me very much. As i ssssaid earlier the ssspear wassss broken into sssssseveral peacesssss, the partssss we had were the ssssshaft and the innately decorated ssssssocket. We have never been able to locate the blade itsssself. Seek the blue onesssss of the foressssst nearby. One of them musssssst still have the sssssocket.'

You loot Innately Decorated Spear Socket

You give the Innately Decorated Spear Socket to Szsen

Szsen says 'Yesssss! Quite beautiful indeed! It isssss good to ssssseee this return! We are ssssssure it wasss the sssspiraling monkey decoratation around the sssssocket that the blue onesssss were ssssso fasssscinated with. It provessss the tree dwellerssss are more than just ssssimple animals! Now we mussssst find the sssshaft, a travelling Monk visssssited Lunarissssss recently and ssssswore to us that the ssssshaft was a relic of the Sha Sun monkssssss. He paid usssss as handssssome price to take the ssshaft to hisss people and promised to return with more information. We have yet to hear from him sssssince that day, hissss name was Qin Chi and we believe he was from the eassssst of Utra. He mentioned sssssomething about the ssssstaff being to do with the violent lizzzzardfolk of the ssssands. I am ssssure if you were to seek the lizzzards you could find the ssssstafff'

You kill the Lizardman Priest and loot Torn and Blooded Robe of Qin Chi

You give Torn and Blooded Robe to Szsen

Szsen says Ohh nooo is thissss the robe of the monk? Thissss is not good! There is another of Qin Chis kind in Tanqara, perhapsssss you sssshould show this to him

You receive Torn and Blooded Robe of Qin Chi

You give Torn and Blooded Robe of Qin Chi to Xon Shu

Xon Shu says 'Bantushi barashan. It is a blessing that we should meet here in this place of desolation where life refuses to succumb to the many challenges that face it.'

You give Torn and Blooded Robe of Qin Chi to Xon Shu

Xon Shu says 'Qin Chi's robe! Fear not, though his robe is blooded and torn he is certainly not dead - his destiny reaches far into the future.'

You say to Xon Shu 'What is the destiny of Qin Chi'

Xon Shu 'That is for the Jade Emperor and Methabeht alone to know. Qin Chi is formidable but his path is not one that is walked alone. It is now for you to join him on his great journey. Seek the card lady, she will take you where you need to go'

You say hail Augur Didyma

Augur Didyma holds her finger to her lips and beckons you to sit. She stands, slowly, and lights two incense that give of a sweet smell. Gathering herself she sits down and places three cards on the table. 'It is time, what do you seek?'

You say 'Qin Chi'

Augur Didyma turns the first card revealing a tower. 'To the east lays a tower, long forgotten now and inhabited by the scaled ones. It is a place of blasphemy in the eyes of the gods, doomed to summon the unwanted, cursed for all who walk its halls. The tower requires a sacrifice to bring the ones its new keepers seek. If you hurry, you may save Qin Chi and prevent another calamity.

You say Hail to Qin Chi

Qin Chi says 'Bantui, barashan. I thank you for killing my captives but I am here by my own will, it is the destiny that has been placed before me by the Gods'

You say what destiny?

Qin Chi says, 'I am here to make a sacrifice, my last sacrifice. You have a path opening up before you, one that has been written in the Kojiki since time immorial. To begin you will require an item very holy, one that had been a shadow of its former self. It was my destiny to bring it back here so it could travel back to the Planes and be whole once more. Now it is time for you to bring it back'

You say how will I bring it back?

Qin Chi says, 'This tower is a cursed contraption, built by snake like beings who no longer slither the deserts of Utra. The Darnans tried to exploit the magic here but all they ever did was summon suffering into the world. The cost of bringing back the item we seek will require my death, one I am happy to give to allow you to complete the great burden you have ahead of you. With my soul in your hand, you must use it to the floating contraption in the room before us. This will summon the artifact you need. Now barashan, it is time for me to return to Methabeht, do what must be done'

You will Qin Chi

You loot Qin Chis Soul

You summon Oshira Plague Lord

You kill Oshira Plague Lord

You receive Zurvans Staff

You give Zurvans staff to Szsen

Szsen says 'Ssssso Qin Chi was alive? I thought sssssurely the ssssshaft was losssst forever!'

You say he was not alive

Szsen says 'That isssss most unfortunate, he ssssseemed like a good man for one of their kind. In honour of him then ssssurely it behoovesss us to finisssh our quest and complete the ancccient sssspear? What do you think? Issss thissss something you would be interessssted in'

You say I shall complete the quest

Szsen says 'Then we must now find the missssssing blade head of the sssspear. We know the sssstaff predatesss the Darnar sssssooo it may be wisssse for usss to conssssult ssssome of the oldesssst peoplesss of Utra. The Kenku are hosssstile to usss even to this day but the Bullywugsssss may be more accommodating. Ssssseek their village in the blackfeather plainssssss and sssssee if you can find anything about the ssssspear head. Even if the current population of Bulwugssss are not aware of the sssspear, it may be pressssent in their ancient mythssss and ssssstories'

You say 'SHOP' to Lorekeeper_Hurbl

THE GREAT CROSSING

THOUGH I WAS JUST
A SMALL TADPOLE
I REMEMBER THE DAY
OF THE GREAT
CROSSING AS IF IT
WAS YESTERDAY

15 WEEKS OF BITTER
WIND BY ANCIENT
RAFT ACROSS
AN UNFORGIVING
SEA DID WE TRAVEL

FILLED WITH
CREATURES LARGER
THAN MOUNTAINS
EACH SEEKING TO
TEAR US LIMB FROM
LIMB

DEAD WOULD WE HAVE
BEEN HAD IT NOT
BEEN FOR OUR
GREATEST HERO
LORD SIGIG

WITH HIS SPEAR
BLESSED BY SUR'EL
EACH BEAST FELL
BACK INTO THE
DEPTHS AND WE
TRAVELED ONWARDS
FURTHER INTO
THE STORM

AS THE DANGER
PASSED THERE DID
WE FIND LAND ON
THE BARREN COAST
LONG FROM QYLIA
LONG FROM THE
UNDER
LONG FROM THOSE
I WOULD CALL MY
ANCESTORS

AS WE LANDED
WE FOUND THE ISLAND
HOME TO THE SCALED,
SNAKE AND DRAGON
ALIKE

FOOD WE WERE FOR
MANY MOON CYCLES
BUT ENDURE WE
ALWAYS HAVE, WHERE
WE COULD FIGHT
WE WOULD, LONG
BATTLES WITH THE
BIRD ONES, BITTER
OF OUR NEW HOME
IN THE SWAMPS
THEY MADE HOME

LORD SIGIG WITH
HIS SHINING SILVER
SPEAR, FORGED
BY THE MOON
GODDESS AND GIFTED
BY THE OCEAN LORD
STOOD AT THE FRONT
OF OUR LINES

SO GREAT WAS THE
LORD, EVEN THE
GODS BLESSED
HIM ON THE EVE
OF THE BATTLE

PROMISING ALL THAT
FOLLOW HIM ETERNAL
ENTRY INTO GARDEN
OF THE GODS

ON SO WE FOUGHT
THE SKY RAINED
THE BEAKED ONES
THOUSANDS UPON
THOUSANDS FELL
AND AS WE BREACHED
THE NEST WE SAW
WHY THE BIRD ONES
FOUGHT WITH SUCH
FERVOR

SLEEPING, ENCIRCLING
THE CENTRE OF THE
NEST LAY A MIGHTY
CHILD OF KUMARI
ITS GREATH BODY
ENCIRCLING A BROOD
OF EGGS AND
LIGHTNING CRACKLING
FROM ITS BLACK
SCALED BODY

THE STORM DRAGON
UNWOUND ITSELF FROM
ITS BROOD AND
SHREDDED ITS CLAW
THROUGH THE
STRONGEST OF OUR
RANKS, STEEL AND
SKIN TORN APART IN
A FLASH

STEPPING FORWARD
CAME SIGIG SLAMMING
HIS GREAT SPEAR
DOWN INTO THE GROUND
MARKING A LINE
BEFORE THAT AGED
SERPENT

HE BECKONED US BACK
WITH A SORROWFUL
SMILE, PROMISING US
HE WOULD SEE US ONCE
MORE, WHEN THE MOON
GATE OPENS AND THE
GODS WELCOME US
INTO THE GARDEN

THE GREAT DRAGON
SPREAD ITS MASSIVE
WINGS OUTWARDS,
COVERING THE NIGHT
SKY WITH A BLACK
SHADOW, ITS HUGE
LEGS BUCKLED DOWN
INTO THE GROUND AND
ITS EYES FILLED WITH
RAGE AS IT GAZED
DIRECTLY AT SIGIG
AND LET LOOSE
A MIGHTY ROAR
THROWING US ALL TO
OUR FEET

THE LAST WE SAW WAS
LORD SIGID CHARGE
FORTH LAUNCHING HIS
SPEAR INTO THE
SCALES OF THE GREAT
SCALED ONE. THE
DRAGON WAILED AND
LASHED ABOUT, ITS
MIGHTY NECK KNOCKING
OVER THE BEAKED ONES
IT SNAPPED ITS MIGHTY
HEAD AT THE THE
IMMOVABLE SIGIG, ITS
RAZER SHARP TEETH
SLICING INTO THE
CHEST OF OUR CHOSEN

IT WRITHED LEFT AND
RIGHT SMASHING SIGIG
INTO THE ROOF AND
WALLS OF THE BROOD
CHAMBER AND WITH A
RUNNING CHARGE BURST
THROUGH THE BUILDING
AND INTO THE SKY
CARRYING AWAY OUR
GREATEST CHAMPION

IN THE DISTANCE WE
COULD SEE SIGIG
SWIPING DEFIANTLY,
THE SCREAMS OF THE
DRAGON ECHOING
THROUGH THE
BLACKFEATHER - THE
BEAKED ONES LOOKING
ON OUR RANKS, NOW
WITHOUT THEIR
MIGHTY PROTECTOR
BEGAN TO RETREAT

BLOODY AND TORN, WE
TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY
TO RETREAT, THE
BEAKED ONES PARTED
LIKE A RETREATING
SHORE AS WE RETURNED
HOME, ALL THE WHILE
LISTENING TO A
DARK AND SORROWFUL
CRY OF SOMETHING
GREAT WAILING IN
THE MOUNTAINS THAT
LOOMED OVER HEAD

IT HAS BEEN MANY
MANY YEARS SINCE
LORD SIGIG LEFT US
AND WE HAVE NEVER
SINCE HEARED OF
THE GREAT STORM
DRAGON OF THE
BLACKFEATHER

TADLINGS STILL
BELIEVE SIGIG
FIGHTS ON, DEEP
WITHIN THE CHASMS
OF THE DRAGON SPINE
MOUNTAINS SHALL
ONE DAY RETURN TO
LEAD US INTO THE
LAND WHICH WAS
PROMISED SO LONG AGO

Szsen says 'What a fascccccinating sssssstory! Thossssse creaturessss never wissssh to ssssspeak to me, i ssssupose thissss explainssss their disssstrussssst for lizzzzzardfolkssssss. If this Sssssgig sssspear is that which we sssseek then it is likely in the mountainsssss somewhere in the blackfeather plainsssss. It sssso happens there is a contractor in Tanqara that may know more about the minessss up there. Sssspeak to him and sssssee if he has come acrosss anything unusual in the dragonsssspine mountains'

You say 'have you seen anything unusual in the dragonspine mountains' to Contractor_Kuram

Contractor_Kuram says 'We find unusual stuff all the time, we toss most of it up in the mountains. Sometimes if we find something valuable the guys may take it to the pawnbroker. He doesnt pay much but its something. I guess you are better speaking to him about unusual stuff'

You say hail pawnbroker

Pawnbroker says 'Hello, looking for something in particular?'

You say i am searching for something unusual

Pawnbroker says 'Hmm unusual... well that could be many of the things i have, perhaps you could be more specific?'

You say i am looking for a spear

Pawnbroker says 'Spear yes... not the only one' he whispers 'are you with Lord Murag?'

You say who is murag

Pawnbroker says 'Oh nothing, nothing, forget i ever said anything'

You kill Lord Murag

You have looted Spear Head 

You give Spear Head to Szsen 'Isssss thissss possssssible? The ssssspear head hasss been found!! What a wonderful sssssuprise! You have made Szsen ssssoo very happy! Here take thisssss note from Guzel, he has completed your transsssssssslation, as for your help I hope this will come in ussssse one day'

You receive THE SWORD OF HEAVEN

You receive Darnan RIng of Majesty

You have gained experience!

It was only in our
darkest moment in
last days of the
wars with the
dragons that Cynem
returned. His powers
far greater than he
had ever possessed,
slew countless
dragons with an army
of Dracoliches and
undead. Holding in
his hands the Sword
of Heaven of our God

Cynem completed his
task and returned
once more far below
the belly of Utra.
Some say he
experiments on our
father, extending
his own powers and
still trying to open
that way back home
perhaps one day he
will suceed or more
likely, we will all
be judged for what
we have done


You loot Darnar Contraption

You give Ssasri Darnar Contraption

Yesss i would be most interesssssted in this fasssscinating toy! Where did you get it, it looks aged, and does not seem Tanqaran or Lunathian. Issss this perhapss from the ruins?'

You say it is from the ruins

Tinkerer Ssasri says 'How very sssstrange! That the old onessss would create sssssuch marvelous thingssss. I bet perhapssss you might find sssssomeone in Avaris who may know more?'

You say What is Avaris?

Tinkerer Ssasri says 'Avaris yesss, a distant city, it is believed they have been here for sssssome time but they do not like outsssssiderssss like usss. Perhapssss you may find a way to speak to them'

You say what way?

Tinkerer Ssasri says 'The way to Avaris is quite far from here, you may find be able to find a guide there in the Orcish kingdom of Arrr, it is far south eassssst from here. If you are travelling there perhapssss you can do me a favour? I have a delivery, a ssssspecial clock for an Orc called Xug. If you take thisssss to him, he will reward you on my behalf'

You receive Clock of Forgotten Souls

You give Clock of Forgotten Souls to Shadowknight Xug

Shadowknight Xug says 'Finally Xug get my clock back! I knew stupid lizard be no use. Let me see, ugghhh yess it fixed now! Ok he no so bad. Here you take some gold, Xug no need shiny things'

You receive A Bag of Gold Coins

You say hail Darlan Cavediver

Darlan Cavediver says ‘Darlan Cavediver, Legendary explorer and Private Investigator at your service! What ancient wonders and lost treasures are you and I to find? What songs will the bards sing of our extraordinary adventures? For a small bag of gold you can hire my outstanding abilities and your troubles, no matter how great, shall be no more!’

You give 'Darlan Cavediver' a bag of gold coins

Darlan Cavediver says 'What luck! Such a day in such a place we two were to cross paths! Maybe we have met before? No matter! What matters is we are here together now. Me, a legendary explorer and you, a person, together to begin a grand adventure across the vast oceans of this world, riches and treasures await, great stories to be written and all for an affordable, renewable payment plan'

You say I seek a treasure

Darlan Cavediver says 'Of course you seek a treasure! Who would not? And what a better person to find that treasure than the legendary Darlan Cavediver? I've found quite a few treasures you know, over my many years! Young you may think I am from my humble, well kept appearance but Darlan Cavediver is over 6000 years old by my reckoning! I don't know how or why but lets just say I have always been here and the gods willing will be here for many more moons to come. Now is this treasure a vast hoard, an ancient weapon or a lost powerful tome of ages gone?'

You say it is a weapon

Darlan Cavediver says 'Yes it is indeed a weapon! A great weapon that will turn you into the worlds greatest killing machine! I know this because I have met people just like you before. You can trust in Darlan Cavediver to find this magical bow.... no? axe  mmm?... sword ?'

You say it is a sword

Darlan Cavediver says 'Ahaha see! I knew we had a connection! Some say Darlan has a type of psychic power to read the minds of those he is sent by the Gods to help. Now we shall find this sword oh yes! Almost very very soon, as soon as Darlan is allowed to leave that is'

You say allowed?

Darlan Cavediver says 'Oh yes well, I am a great explorer as you have no doubt heard in the taverns all over Solinia. Sometimes great journeys require an adventurer like myself to make certain agreements and deals with people to facilitate the many important duties I have to complete on my way. Like for example, the Orcs here say I owe them my eternal servitude for the theft of weapons from the amourer in the middle of the night. I say how can you brandish such words as theft to a man such as Darlan Cavediver? Objects are merely instruments allowing me to complete the many great feats that change the very fate of life on Solinia.'

You say you are bound in servitude

Darlan Cavediver says 'For now I am apparently enslaved to the Orc Chieften of ARRR, am I saying ARRRR right? You have to scream its name, yes? Well until ARRRR sees me fit for release, the great adventurers of Darlan Cavediver must come to a halt! You could however, speak to the Chieften yourself and perhaps get him to agree to release me? Of course I would then be able to continue the necessary dangerous and exceptionally complex work needed to help you to recover this great and mighty sword you seek'

You say hail Chief Gurok

Chief Gurok says 'You walk before Gurok, what makes you worthy to stand before the mightiest of Orcs?'

You say how can i make myself worthy

Chief Gurok says 'Gurok know of your invasion of Redfang, this pleased Gurok. Gurok let you walk into ARRR because of this. But how Gurok know you wont steal from ARRR like you steal from stupid Redfangs? Why Gurok trust you?'

You say how can i make you trust me

Chief Gurok says 'Gurok have brother, he stupid, he good fighter but he stupid. He get lost, far south at Goblin fortress. He captive and need to be free, no brother of Gurok should be held by smelly goblin creature. You find brother Lok save Gurok brother and we trust you.

You say Hail Lok

You recieve Arena Champions Token

You give Arena Champions Token to Gurok

Gurok says 'Hahaha! Gurok saw fight! You not so weedy as you look! Gurok now think you worthy. Gurok smart to let you in city. Now gurok wonder what you want'

You say I want to free Darlan

Gurok says 'Darlan is Gurok slave now, he try to steal from ARRR. We consider bash his head in and feast on him in stew, but he look kind of stinky and not in good way. If you want Darlan you have to buy him as he property of Gurok. Why you want such stupid slave I never know.'

You say I want to buy him

Gurok says 'Ok ok, I consider to sell but not for shiny gold piece. Gurok want someone dead, you good at fighting. The flappy people to east cause Gurok so many problem. We want to spread ARRR, but they no like Guroks people. They have princess, she very stroppy lady. You kill her and give Gurok her wings. Ahahahaha, yes this be good! I give you Darlan for this.'

You kill Princess Celina

You loot Wings of Princess Celina

You give Wings of Princess Celina to Gurok

Gurok says 'AHhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!! She dead! You best fighter! Darlan yours now, you take his key and use him as you will'

Gurok gives you Darlans Key

You give Darlans Key to Darlan Cavediver

Darlan Cavediver says 'Finally my freedom! Yes unlock me from these frightful shackles so a great explorer can be free once more to roam a world in need of his aid! Wait, what, you are not going to free me? ARE YOU KIDDING ME. I will not be a slave! No wait... no dont leave.... ok fine... fine.. look if I help you find your sword, you will free me right?'

You say I will free you

Darlan Cavediver says 'Alright! Good, we are communicating! You receive the aid of the great explorer Darlan Cavediver and I receive my freedom! This is a fair price, and believe me when I say how sorry I am that I have already spent the gold you gave me. You see anyone will tell you I am quite industrious and despite my shackles I was able to bribe me way to freedom twice in your absense. Now back to the Sword, Do you have any idea where it may be?'

You say Avaris

Darlan Cavediver says 'Avaris, a second home to Darlan Cavediver! Even the mention of my name will have you rolling into the main halls. We could go right away but they wont let you in without an Avaran Seal! I did have one, but I lost it during a long loving relationship with a Siren of the south. I could go with you but since you insist on keeping me shackled like a djinn you will have to find it yourself. Bring me my entry seal from the sirens on the south coast and I will arrange us a wagon that will take us to the city. Dont be too long, the orcs get bored and poor dashing Darlan Cavediver starts to get funny looks from the orc women when the moon comes up. I cant go through that thrice, i simply cant

You loot Darlans Magical Seal

You giveDarlans Magical Seal to Darlan Cavediver

Darlan Cavediver says 'Aha! You have unwittlingly fallen into one of Darlan Cavedivers many unavoidable ruses! This is not an Avaran Entry Seal but a teleportation device that will take me back to my Sirens dear city where you shall never find me again! This will teach you for keeping me shackled! We could have been such friends!

*Darlan Cavediver dissapears*
