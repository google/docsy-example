Apart from the small outposts of the Kandamese and the entrance to the city of Kandam itself there are no civilisations that exist in this jungle.  **Local Wildlife**  Bog slugs, snakes and many dangerous reptiles.  **Transport Links**  The only methods of entrance to the jungle itself is through a cave entrance in the swamp of Scheria. Giving the Kandam empire a relatively defensive position against outsiders.  **Locations of Interest**  The Lost Temple of Araz  **Threats**  Most of the wildlife here is extremely deadly, if you do survive the brutal attacks from one of these creatures the poisons they hold will surely get you in the long run.  **History**  After the fall of the city of Eusebes the Kandam tribe settled here. Being people of war and battle they found the inhospitable lands a place to focus their strength in honour of their god of war and a perfect place to train their young. In time the village of Kandam became a city and recently the fortress of the entire empire that rules the majority of Alcor with an iron fist.
