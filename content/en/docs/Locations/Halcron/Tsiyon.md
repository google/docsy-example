Tsiyon
{{% /pageinfo %}}
Tsiyon could be considered the world capital and home to many of the races of Solinia. It's roots began as a small farming and fishing settlement on the southern edge of Halcron which really began it's golden age following the arrival of the sea faring Vishim . Trading technology and some making their home in Tsiyon eventually led to significant world trade and exploration of the south western regions of Solinia. <span class="line-spacer d-block"> </span> Before the arrival of the Vishim, the city itself was a lot smaller than today and without many of the districts. The original inhabitants which the Vishim first encountered are undoubtedly some form of descendent of Eusebians although they have never encountered their ancestors due to the difficulty in exploring the land of Alcor. The people of Halcron, who refer to their ancient selves as the Meroei, would always say they have inhabitted the lands and do not have any recorded history of ever leaving other continents of islands in search of new homes but infact their history stems from the times long before the modern era when their people fled underground to escape the cataclysm.

## Military District

### Facilities

 for training infantry in melee combat as well as an offshoot of the Moracre Ranger Guild who spend their time teaching the art of archery. The Paladins also make their home here. In the center of the district lay fountains and trees which are occasionally used as a gathering area while the King of Tsiyon addresses his subject from the Old Palace battlements.
<span class="line-spacer d-block"> </span>
This district lies directly north of the Docks and due West of the Shared Housing District. It is also the location of the Northern Gate.
<span class="line-spacer d-block"> </span>
The military district is also home to the Tsiyon Infirmary.
<span class="line-spacer d-block"> </span>
It is the only way for outsiders to pass into the private racial areas and royal palace which lie to the east.
<span class="line-spacer d-block"> </span>
Acropolis is part of the original wall that surrounds the dock area and used to act as a gatehouse for the village. However since the major expansion of the city, new walls have been errected all around the new districts. Acropolis and the old city walls are a reminder to the Meroei of their past and the promise the royal bloodline made to keep their people safe.

## Assets


            <div>Tsiyon was the location of birth of the global currency. Due to the expense in dealing with individual race currencies a central bank was created by the mixed races of Tsiyon to ease the expense and delay it held on trade. Since the creation of this currency most cultures have benefited from prosperity and see it as one of the benefits of racial diplomacy.</div>
