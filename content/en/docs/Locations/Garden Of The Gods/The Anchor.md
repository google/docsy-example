The Anchor
{{% /pageinfo %}}
The anchor is currently an overgrown tree mixed in with what looks like ancient technology  It is protected by a sacred order who are xenophobic to outsiders  Methabeht is here holding the past together  The Anchor is an ancient device constructed over a gigantic circular hole which binds the past to the future  It is believed the enormous hole was created during a massive collision with an asteroid or moon  The Anchor was destroyed during the events of the Last War of the Gods  During The Anchors destruction, Methabeht sacrificed himself to keep the chains of the past and present bonded together. An enormous Tree now sits over the site, its roots binding the broken chains of The Anchor  **Inhabitants**  Solinia - A female and last living descendent of the Dal  The Great Tree - Living remains of Methabeht
