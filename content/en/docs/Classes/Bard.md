Bards have songs has spells and only some use mana, some repeat to the infinite until you use a new song or an enemy resist a damage song. You can use more than one song at time but only the last one used will repeat while the other will end with the corresponding message in chat that says:" 's song has come to a close [NameOfTheSong], by finding a good timing between some songs, you can cycle between songs without waiting any time. For example 4 psalms have the duration of 12 seconds and a casting time of 3 seconds, meaning you can cycle between them without waiting.

At the start the player would be given 100$, with these money it's advised to buy the tiny dagger from the weaponsmith then to get the lvl 1 and lvl 2 spell from the bard shop and buying the flute, drum, lute and drums, each of these give useful modifiers when holded in the off hand. After doing that you should be able to farm the lvl 1 mobs to get some equipment for your Bard class or other classes, it's reccomended to sell the equipment from other classes so it's faster to get the other spells for the bard class. After farming some money the other spells to buy are the Hymn of restoration and whistling warson, both are useful buff spells at the start.

If you can't find all the shops, just go to  captain wavebreaker at Morheim and travel to Highguard, then talk with captain windblast and travel to shasun and there you'll find all the bard's lvl shops currently available.
