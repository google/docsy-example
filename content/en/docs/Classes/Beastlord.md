**Description**

Beastlords are the masters of the raw energies of the spirit realm. They can focus these energies into themselves and their warder pets. 

Beastlords are primarily a melee class, with the ability to wear leather armor or use their bare hands to attack.

Beastlords prepare for battle by calling on their animal warder and increasing the creature's natural abilities with spells 

Beastlords are one of the major 4 pet classes and as such are highly dependent on their companions
