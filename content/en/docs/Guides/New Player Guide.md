**Code of Conduct** 

Please first read our [Code of Conduct](../code-of-conduct) documentation to be sure you know the rules involved playing on our server 

**Overview** 

This document will aim to be a reference booklet for new and old players of Fall of an Empire. It will cover all areas of the current storyline at the time of posting as well as the mechanics involved in playing on our server It is recommended you print a copy of this document to keep as your guide while you travel the Worlds of Solinia 

**Time** 

You are able to see the specific date you are in by typing /today in chat and the name of the day and date will come up. Day and night cycles on Solinia are roughly ¼ that of a Real life one (24hrs) This is very useful for Roleplaying effectively and Remembering Births/Deaths too. Amaria is an archipaelo that snakes across the far south east of the planet Solinia. The island chain itself is currently undiscovered by most races of Solinia. Due to the sizes of the islands and the peculiarity of its position on the planet there lays a variety of topical features from wind swept deserts to frigid icy plains. The area of Solinia that Fall of an Empire takes place is populated by a variety of races that have recently arrived here following the events of The Great Reunification, an act of a divine being that has brought mythical civilisations throughout Solinias history into a new unified and undiscovered world You are able to see map of Amaria and your location on it, by going onto the website and clicking dynmap http://play.fallofanempire.com:8123/ You can also find more information about and it's races by visiting our Amaria page

**Server Guide** 

**New Tutorial**

The server has a new in game tutorial, please see https://www.fallofanempire.com/docs/guides/tutorialfortutorial

**Creating your character** 

Now that you are familiar with the storyline of Solinia it’s time to get your character created! To start with, you will have to think about the personality of your character and perhaps think about a summary of your character. For example,

Sergei Avalo is a male (race name, for example Aerindal), recognizable for his (easily spotted features here). He is (personality listed here in three or four words). He has a talent: he (talent listed here) He tends to (hobby listed here) and is (normal interaction with others listed here). He is (goal listed here). If you asked him, he would say that his ideal is, (ideal listed here) If he has a flaw, it is that he is (flaw listed here.) 

Once you have procured your character summary, you will want to think about the looks of your character; these are shaped by their race and class as well as age. An old knight, for example, would wield many scars from experiencing battles, while a young Exarch would carry around a cross around his neck and act religious. Keladun are essentially dwarves, and both males and females in the race have beards, so inevitably you would own a beard if you were to be a Keladun, while if you were to be an Aerindal you would likely have predominately blonde hair. Once you have thought about the looks, create a skin, or find one online! For many of you, skins could be hard to find, but fret not about it, they say that the description of the character isn't shown through the skin, rather through how the person plays it. 

**Starting in the world** 

When you start in the world make sure to check out the surrounding area before heading out. you have been given $100 to spend at the local vendor in order to equip your character with a way to protect themselves with a sword and armor. Once you have been successfully equipped with equipment you should head to the dungeon close to spawn and fight your way through the variety of mobs. After you have completed the dungeon you should have collected enough money to buy more equipment, or be on your way and go explore the world. 

**Setting your avatars name** 

Now that you have your characters background established, its time to set your name /Forename [Firstname] /Lastname [Lastname] eg /Forename Petal eg /Lastname Deyhl You can change your name at any time if you want to change your character by issuing the same commands! Please make it believable and in keeping with the continuity of the server. **Setting your race** Now that you have your characters background established its time to set your race. Note some races may be inactive. You can find out the active races on our website /Race [Racename] 

See [races](../../races) 

**Setting your class** 

Professions are specialisations that determine your avatars statistics, abilities and skills. You may only set your profession once and this is done through our introduction questline. You can find out more about professions via the /classinfo command - you can also see their abilities on our page /class [Classname] 

See [Classes](../../classes) 

**Earning money** 

Fall of an empire uses its own internal economy plugins to allow players to interact with merchant NPC's to sell and buy items. Just like with NPC quests, right click NPC's which are buying or selling items and they will list everything they are interested in trading Click on each item you wish to buy or sell to complete a transaction

Killing mobs is a great way to make money if you are just starting off. To check your balance at any time use the command /balance or /bal You can also pay other players using the /pay command with /pay playername amount 

**Chat** 

You can use /ch local to enter into the Local channel, for RP (Role-playing) use. ( Heard in 100 block radius ) /ch ooc to enter into out of character global chat mode (Heard by everyone) 

**Parties** 

You can also create a group to talk to players in any distance by using the /group command and /g <msg> to send a message Groups also allow you to earn experience with your fellow heroes as well as monitor their hit points You can invite players to your party with /group invite and list all players in your party with /group list 

**Finding Players** 

You can also see all players online with the command /who all 

**Getting Help with the Help Command** 

With Fall of an Empire constantly changing, sometimes not everything can be written in a guide. Thanks to our helpful community you can request help with the /ooc <question> command This will send your question to all players currnetly active in out of character

You may also find help in our discord channel on the right side of our main website [www.fallofanempire.com](www.fallofanempire.com)

**Building and Player Cities** 

In Fall of an Empire, the world is divided into two types of areas: Player Build Areas and Campaign Areas. You cannot build or destroy in Campaign Areas but players are welcome to build whatever they like in the player areas, so long as it follows the server rules To protect the environment from griefing and managing abandoned areas, players must purchase any land they wish to build or destroy on. For this we use towny (see below) Although anyone can create an area for themselves in a player build area, we recommend all payers join an already established town to facilitate RP. However, if you are a hermit type, you can pay the fee of $500 to purchase a town with the /town create command You can find player build areas on our dynmap 

**Establishing a new Town** 

To create your own town you need to be in the Wilderness. That’s anywhere where a town doesn’t exist already. When you walk around it will say ~Wilderness This means you are standing in a chunk that is currently unoccupied. To found your town there you can use this command /town new Townname This will establish a town at your position assuming you have the money to pay for it. The size of the town will start out at 16x16 blocks wide and all the way from bedrock to the sky. To keep your town you need to pay Upkeep this is important to remember and you can see the prices using the towny prices command /towny prices To deposit money into your town bank so your upkeep continues to be paid daily use the /town deposit command *Run out of money in your town bank and your town will fall* /town deposit amount You can also see the balance of your town bank with /town or /t 

**Inviting new Residents to your town** 

To invite others to your town, you can use the command /town invite [name] Once the player joins they will be a member of your town and will show on the town resident list on /town 

**Extending your town** 

You can extend your town by standing in an adjacent ~WildLand area and typing /town claim Prices are shown on the /towny prices command - you can also extend your town in large chunks with /town claim rect amount Which claims area around your town at a distance of ‘amount’ If you want to claim a plot that is not adjacent to your town will need to be claimed as an outpost, these are more expensive and are shown on /towny prices /town claim outpost 

**Marking your town plots for sale** 

If you want to sell plots for your residents in your town you can stand in an area and do forsale command /plot forsale [AMOUNT] Where amount is the price you want to sell the plot for You can unlist it for sale with /plot notforsale Residents can buy plots with /plot claim 

**Character Development** 

When you begin to play on Fall of an Empire you will be an unknown profession. During this time you will not be able to wear class armour, use class abilities or take advantage of class statistics and skills Unknown profession players can also never level beyond level 10

By the time you complete your introduction quest, you should have chosen one of the core classes available to players 

**Targetting Mobs for Spells & Auto Attack** 

To target mobs right click on your target . You will see a glow around the mob you have targetted and also see the mob that is targetted in your target area on the right

To start auto attacking you can use the keybind Z

To cast a memorised spell see the area below

**Targetting yourself for Spells** 

To target yourself please see your keybinds, by default this is ctrl - 1

You will see your name in the target area on the right

**Clearing your target** 

To clear your target please see your keybinds, by default this is ctrl - ¬

**Adding spells to your spellbook**

**Opening your spellbook**

To open your spellbook please see your keybinds, by default this is K

**Memorising spells**

To unmemorise a spell right click the memorised spell in the top left of your screen

**Casting Spells** 

To cast a spell on an NPC please see your keybinds, by default this is ALT 1 to 8, where each number represents the memorisation slot you will be casting from.

You must have an entity targetted to cast on them (see above for targetting)

**Auto Attack** 

To auto attack, please see your keybinds, by default this is the Z button

Target the NPC and press (by default) Z and you will attack automatically

Auto attacking also benefits from haste buffs and attack skills you may have aquired so is the recommended way to engage in combat. It is also less painful than clicking hundreds of times!

**Spell Reagents** 

Some spells require reagents which you can get from drops and shops.

Hold the reagent in your hand when in the inventory window and drop it onto the reagent button in the top right corner of the screen

Alternatively you can type /reagent add

Various vendors in cities spell reagents for spells. Some powerful or rare spells may require mob drops for the reagents.

**Bind Wound** 

Players can bind their wounds with /bindwound (/bw for short), this requires bandages in your /reagent pouch 

**Gear** 

Scattered among the various merchants and lost dungeons of solinia lay many forgotten items of power which increase player statistics and grant unique bonuses that players cannot find elsewhere such as spell resistances and mana regeneration Items and weapons often can only be used by specific players so be sure to inspect the item before purchasing

Some items slot into special equipment slots that display on the right side of your inventory window

To remove items from your equipment slots you can right click the slot

**Skills** 

Each class provides a number of Skills for your character to learn using /skills Skills range from language to magic and melee skills and affect how various mechanics work in Fall of an Empire. These are generally damage modifiers, resists and other passive 'always on' effects. Skills have a limited value that generally is determined by your level and for resists can be raised by certain special items. 

**Abilities and Spells** 

Abilities and Spells are items that can be found in game that look like enchanted books. There are hundreds of abilities that have all manner of effects from beneficial to destructive or even utility. Abilities can be purchased from most Profession Guilds in large NPC cities, special abilities can also be found on monsters throughout the world and hidden vendors scattered around Solinia.

To use an ability you will need to drop the spell book into your spell button in the top right of your inventory. Once it is in your spellbook you can open the spellbook with the K keybind. Spells can be chosen and placed into memorisation slots at hte top of your screen by left clicking on the spell and left clicking on a memorisation slot. You can quick cast these spells by default with ALT-1 ALT-2 ALT-3 etc.  At the right of the screen you will notice you have a TARGET:. Targets can be selected by right clicking an npc or palyer. Note some abilities require a target where as others, such as area of effect will target yourself automatically. Abilities require Mana/Power which can be found at the top of your screen. You can regenerate mana by holding crouch or using /trance (shortcut /tr) which will play you in a meditative trance until you move As you raise your characters level your mana pool will raise, this can also be increased by items with statistics on them such as INT, WIS or AGI depending on your profession 

**Pet Classes** 

Some pets require reagents, such as bone chips to summon your skeleton pet or malachie to summon a magician pet. Put these inyour reagent pouch with /reagent add or drop the reagents onto the reagent icon in the top right corner of your inventory screen.

To make your pet attack another mob, first target the mob with right click. Then use the keybind for Pet Attack (default R) to send your pet in. You can also control this with /pet attack and stop attack with /pet back. 

Another useful command is /pet equip to destroy the item you are holding and give it to your pet. 

See more info on your pet with the /pet command. 

**Pet Equipment** 

You can forfeit an item to let your pet wear it. Hold the item in your hand and type /pet equip. You will lose this item. Equipping pets will significantly increase their performance in combat 

**Alternative Advancement** 

When a player reaches level 50 they are able to access the /toggleaa command. This will begin siphoning all experience gained into alternative advancement which will reward points that can be spent on new character powers in the /AA command AAs can massively increase a players power far beyond what tradition levels can and allows players to keep progressing their character despite reaching maximum level 

**Roleplaying Tools** 

**Try to stay in character** 

When roleplaying try not to break out of character, we know it’s not possible to stop this, so when you need to break out of character just put two brackets before and after your message eg "(( Sorry guys, I got to go in 10 minutes ))" instead of " I’ve to go in 10 minutes " ( in character ). Alternatively use the /ch localooc channel or the /looc command 

**Racial languages** 

Each race of Solinia speak a unique language that cannot be understood by foreigners. By default your character will speak your racial tongue in /local RP chat As you hear more of another racial tongue you will eventually be able to understand it and even speak it by toggling your racial tongue with the /language command

Languages augment roleplay and allow unique tense scenarios where players of another land may not understand the secret words you are saying to your allies - get out there and travel the lands to learn more of them! 

**Emote!** 

Also when physically doing something in roleplay use an emote to perform your action ie: /me picks up the empty vase, and inspects it closely 

**Leave it up to random!** 

Use the /dice to add some randomness to your roleplay 

**Consult the gods** 

Tarot has guided the kings of Solinia for as long as they have existed. Leave your decisions up to the /tarot command next time you have to decide something difficult 

**Travel** 

Getting around isn’t easy, so we recommend using map.solinia.com while travelling long distances. Remember, travel with friends where possible and be sure to grab a saddle from a Horse Vendor and use a steed. If the journey is a long one, stock up on rations so you don't get stuck in the wild with no food or find a friendly druid and wizard who can teleport you to various locations around the world.
