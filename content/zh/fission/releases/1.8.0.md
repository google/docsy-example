# Features

## Go 1.13 support

Go 1.13 environment images are now online.

* runtime: `fission/go-env-1.13`
* builder: `fission/go-builder-1.13` 

## Dry option to view the generated spec

Now you can view the generated spec without actually saving it by add `--dry`.

```bash
$ fission env create --name go \
    --image fission/go-env-1.13:1.8.0 --builder fission/go-builder-1.13:1.8.0 --dry
```

## Resource setting for fetcher

Now you are able to configure fetcher resource setting before helm installation.   

{{% notice warning %}}
Fetcher is for downloading or uploading archive. </br>
Low resource `limits` will increase the function specialization time and make specialization timeout. </br>
Normally, you don't need to change the default value, unless necessary.
{{% /notice %}}

```yaml
fetcher:
  image: fission/fetcher
  imageTag: 1.8.0
  resource:
    cpu:
      requests: "10m"
      limits: ""
    mem:
      requests: "16Mi"
      limits: ""
```
