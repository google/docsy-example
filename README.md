# Docsy Example

[Docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy) is a Hugo theme for technical documentation sites, providing easy site navigation, structure, and more. This **Docsy Example Project** uses the Docsy theme, as well as providing a skeleton documentation structure for you to use. You can either copy this project and edit it with your own content, or use the theme in your projects like any other [Hugo theme](https://gohugo.io/themes/installing-and-using-themes/).

This Docsy Example Project is hosted at [https://example.docsy.dev/](https://example.docsy.dev/).

You can find detailed theme instructions in the Docsy user guide: https://docsy.dev/docs/

This is not an officially supported Google product. This project is currently maintained.

## Cloning the Docsy Example Project

The following will give you a project that is set up and ready to use (don't forget to use `--recurse-submodules` or you won't pull down some of the code you need to generate a working site). The `hugo server` command builds and serves the site. If you just want to build the site, run `hugo` instead.

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules --depth 1 https://github.com/google/docsy-example.git
cd docsy-example
hugo server
```

The theme is included as a Git submodule:

```bash
▶ git submodule
 a053131a4ebf6a59e4e8834a42368e248d98c01d themes/docsy (heads/master)
```

If you want to do SCSS edits and want to publish these, you need to install `PostCSS` (not needed for `hugo server`):

```bash
npm install
```

<!--### Cloning the Example from the Theme Project


```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules --depth 1 https://github.com/docsy.git
cd tech-doc-hugo-theme/exampleSite
HUGO_THEMESDIR="../.." hugo server
```


Note that the Hugo Theme Site requires the `exampleSite` to live in a subfolder of the theme itself. To avoid recursive duplication, the example site is added as a Git subtree:

```bash
git subtree add --prefix exampleSite https://github.com/google/docsy.git  master --squash
```

To pull in changes, see `pull-deps.sh` script in the theme.-->

## Running the website locally

Once you've cloned the site repo, from the repo root folder, run:

```
hugo server
```

### Running a container locally

You can run docsy-example inside a [Docker](ihttps://docs.docker.com/)
container, the container runs with a volume bound to the `docsy-example`
folder. This approach doesn't require you to install any dependencies other
than Docker.

1. Build the docker image 

```bash
docker build -f dev.Dockerfile -t docsy-example-dev:latest .
```

1. Run the built image

```bash
docker run --publish 1313:1313 --detach --mount src="$(pwd)",target=/home/docsy/app,type=bind docsy-example-dev:latest
```

Open your web browser and type `http://localhost:1313` in your navigation bar,
This opens a local instance of the docsy-example homepage. You can now make
changes to the docsy example and those changes will immediately show up in your
browser after you save.

To stop the container, first identify the container ID with:

```bash
docker container ls
```

Take note of the hexadecimal string below the `CONTAINER ID` column, then stop
the container:

```bash
docker stop [container_id]
```

To delete the container run:

```
docker container rm [container_id]
```
